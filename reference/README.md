These are bits and pieces we used in building the mask and accesories!

For the female thread you can see two versions, `Gas_Mask_Female_Thread v1` is continuos, while `Gas_Mask_Female_Thread_with_endstop v2` has an stop 10mm into the thread to assure compatibility with all NATO containers.

On the female side it is a similar story, `Gas_Mask_Male_Thread_short v2` was simply shortened to not be pointlesly long when using the shorter female thread. Also keep in my mind that only one side is chamfered for optimal insertion.
