# Open Source Gas Mask

![Image of gas mask](/images/gasmask.png)

NOTE: This is a preliminary design, that still needs testing and refinement.  Do not rely on this to save your life just yet.

This is a 3d printable gas mask design.  It's printed in 3 parts - the main mask, the canister, and a gasket to hold the face shield in.  The face shield is cut from a piece of clear plastic.

The filter material is activated charcoal - you can buy this at any pet store.  Put a layer of cotton batting in the bottom of the canister, then fill with activated charcoal, then put another layer of cotton on top, and screw the canister into the mask.

## Safety Warnings
1. Print Material: PLA can be brittle and sharp in the event that it breaks. Please consider using PETG of Nylon if this could be an issue in the environment you plan on using it - especially if you expect the mask to be subjected to impacts or otherwise stressed.
2. Fit/Seal/Leak Testing: It is highly recommended to test the mask for leaks and fit quality.
3. Exhale/Vent Valve: The amount of dead space inside the mask and filters can lead to a risk of asphyxiation. All masks in this repository have provisions for installing an exhale valve. Please be sure to assemble and install one in every mask.
