# Open Source Gas Mask

![Image of gas mask](/images/gasmask.png)

NOTE: This is a preliminary design, that still needs testing and refinement.  Do not rely on this to save your life just yet.

This is a 3d printable gas mask design.  It's printed in 3 parts - the main mask, the canister, and a gasket to hold the face shield in.  The face shield is cut from a piece of clear plastic.

The filter material is activated charcoal - you can buy this at any pet store.  Put a layer of cotton batting in the bottom of the canister, then fill with activated charcoal, then put another layer of cotton on top, and screw the canister into the mask.

Warning: 1)If you are planning on printing one to use in the real world, DO NOT use pla plastic, pla is very brittle and if it breaks, the shards can cut. Since this is a mask, it will hurt if it breaks on your face!!Same goes for plexiglas. However, if you are using this mask on a day-to-day bases and not putting stress on it, you should be fine but keep in mind to not hit the mask.
2)Every seal should be test fitted and sealed tight. Also having dead space in the filter would be a no no since you will be rebreathing the same air if it doesn't vent to a different location, risking asphyxiation. 
Pull requests welcome!
