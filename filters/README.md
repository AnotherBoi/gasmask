# Filters

This folder contains designs for respirator filters. Designs are organized into folders based on the connector type. The masks in this repo are based on the NATO thread standard. Filters with other connector standards are available in case you want to install an adapter on your mask to make it compatible with a different standard while maintaining the ability to easily use homemade filters.
