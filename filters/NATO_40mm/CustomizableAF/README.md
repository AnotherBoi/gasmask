AF ofcourse meaning Air Filter

is a modular airfilter system. You can pick a main canister and a cap based on your preference. The connection between those is made via an M90 thread, with tolerance added on the cap side to account for the lower precision of household 3d printers.

Feel free to itterate and create more designs.
